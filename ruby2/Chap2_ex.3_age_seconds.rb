#This part of he program will calculate age in seconds.(Answer 1261440000 secs for 40 years)

my_age = 40
seconds_year = (3600 * 24) * 365

puts my_age * seconds_year


#This part of the program will calculate the age starting from seconds.
age_in_seconds = 1160000000
seconds_year = (3600 * 24) * 365

puts age_in_seconds / seconds_year
