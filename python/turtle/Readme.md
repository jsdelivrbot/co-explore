# About the turtledemo folder
I copied the turtledemo folder from my Mac laptop's Python library location
(which was /Users/boultoa/anaconda/lib/python3.5/turtledemo).

This contains many demos of the Python 3.5 turtle library.

## To run the an example
Run an example, e.g. tree.py,  as follows:

    cd turtledemo
    python tree.py
