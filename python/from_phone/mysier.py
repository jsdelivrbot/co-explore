Things that need clarification:

1. Why is this file called mysier.py?
2. What is the ^ symbol?
3. What is << ?
4. why is the form a triangle, on the whole?



Answers:
1. It was originally based on sier.py, hence the my.  But why sier.py?
   Answer: I abbreviated a reference to Sierpinski. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpinski_triangle
   for more.
2. ^ is called caret. It represents the exclusive-or operation, aka XOR. 
   Here's a truth table for XOR, i.e. it shows a ^ b for every possible binary a and b values:
     
              b
      a^b  | 0  1
   --------|------
     a   0 | 0  1
         1 | 1  0
    
  For reference, here is OR, the ordinary (not-exclusive) OR operation:
  
              b
   a or b  | 0  1
   --------|------
     a   0 | 0  1
         1 | 1  1
         
  NOTE: XOR is defined for larger integers than just 0 and 1, by applying it BITWISE.
        What do I mean by BITWISE?  Answer: a bit (aka binary-digit) at a time.
        
        e.g.
        
        0b10110 ^ 0b11011
        
            a = 0b10110
            b = 0b11011
        a ^ b = 0b01101
        
        
        
 
3. << is the binary shift left operator, which is mathematically equivalent to DOUBLING a number.
  
4. This would be the pattern if we just shifted left repeatedly

Claim: For a and b being 0 or 1
a^b =====  (a + b) mod 2   === (a+b)%2
   
              b
  (a+b)%2  | 0  1

     a   0 | 0  1
